# Stock Market Analysis 

Our agenda is to __portray the impact COVID-19 has had on financial markets in 2020__, visualizing the performance of different stock market indeces (SP500, FTSE100, HSI…) throughout the year and identifying the most significant shocks as well as drawing parallels with the events and world news that might have been the cause.

We intend also to conduct an analysis across geographies by creating a geospatial map of major indices around the world and compare the performance in those markets using a heat map.

Furthermore, we intend to analyze the performance across industries and ascertain sectors that were counter-cyclical / robust. 

Additionally, we intend to compare the above to the market’s performance during the 2008 economic crisis and their respective revivals.

For the purpose of this visualization we intend to use Financial market data sources from indices and libraries such as Capital IQ - however, the scope and the data used for the project may vary slightly as we continue to explore the topic.
